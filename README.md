## Getting Started

Welcome to Book Buddy! This innovative project is your personal book recommendation system designed to cater to your reading preferences. Using collaborative-based filtering with scikit-learn, Book Buddy offers a seamless and delightful experience to discover captivating reads.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run Book Buddy, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

<b>Python:</b> Book Buddy is built using Python, so you'll need to have Python installed. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: Python.org.

<b>pip:</b> pip is a package manager for Python that allows you to easily install and manage dependencies. It usually comes pre-installed with Python. To check if you have pip installed, open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```sh
pip --version
```
If you don't have pip installed, you can install it by following the instructions here: Installing pip.

### Installation

Once you have Python and pip installed, follow these steps to set up and run Book Buddy:
<ul>
<li><b>Clone the repository:</b> First, clone the Book Buddy repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
```
</li>


<li><b>Navigate to the project directory:</b> After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory using the terminal/command prompt:

```sh
cd book-buddy
```

</li>

<li><b>Install Dependencies:</b> Next, install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will ensure all the necessary Python libraries are installed to run the Flask app and the machine learning components.

</li>
<li><b>Run the Flask App:</b> After installing the dependencies, start the Flask app by running the following command:

```sh
python app.py
```

This will launch the Flask development server, and you'll see a message indicating that the app is running on a local address (e.g., http://localhost:5000).
</li>
<li><b>Access Book Buddy:</b> Open your web browser and navigate to the address shown in the previous step (e.g., http://localhost:5000). You should now be able to access Book Buddy and begin exploring its features.
</li>
</ul>
Now you're all set! You can start exploring the top 20 books on the homepage or head over to the "Recommend" page to receive personalized book recommendations based on your interests. Enjoy your reading journey with Book Buddy!

## Usage

Once the Flask app is up and running, you can easily navigate through the Book Buddy interface. On the homepage, you will find the top 20 books based on popularity and user ratings. To receive personalized book recommendations, head over to the "Recommend" page and input your interests. Book Buddy will work its magic and present you with a list of books tailored just for you.
